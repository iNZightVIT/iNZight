* Sets fallback addon directory using `tools::R_user_dir('iNZight', 'cache')`

# iNZight 4.1

## Major changes

### Surveys

* NEW: better handling of survey designs using our new 'Survey design specification' format. This allows users to load pre-configured surveys from a single 'specification' file, while may optionally point at a dataset for an all-in-one import.
* survey 'data wrangling' support for almost all operations (others have been greyed out to prevent invalid actions by users); code is valid, using 'srvyr' package to provide 'dplyr'-like syntax for survey designs

### Other

* refactor of the Aggregate Data functionality, allowing users to select more than three variables and to perform aggregation over a subset of variables
* Join data now allows users to select an existing dataset, in addition to importing a new one (#340, @tmelliott)
* updated preferences window to allow new options to be added in future without getting cluttered
* create new 'Form Class Intervals' window connecting to `iNZightTools::form_class_intervals()` function; includes code and a much smoother intervace, with preview of resulting intervals

## Minor changes

* when loading a new data set, exisiting datasets are kept (previously they were all removed; at this point I don't know why that design decision was made ...)
* allow user to delete any dataset (including the original); the previous dataset is loaded in it's place
* user preferences are are now stored in `tools::R_user_dir()`; user is prompted to create config directories
* enable code tidying (which uses the 'styler' package)
* the `disposeR` argument in `iNZight()` has been replaced with `dispose_fun`, allowing users to pass a function to be called when iNZight closes (rather then only allowing `q()`)

## Bug fixes

* fix bug when setting new data object causing code history and data's new name to be lost
* fix small bug in code writing where colon (:) remained in list of packages for installation (#352, @tmelliott)
* add close_module method so modules can close themselves and iNZight's main GUI will be restored correctly


**Plus many other fixes and changes from other iNZight packages**

***

## iNZight 4.0.3

* fix bug preventing `Add to Plot > Axes` from displaying correctly if dot plot variable 1 was the factor (instead of Var2) (#348, @tmelliott)

## iNZight 4.0.2

* fixes a bug in code widget preventing UI from updating correctly (#334, @tmelliott)
* fix bug in *File* > *Reload* causing crash if data hadn't been loaded yet (#332, @tmelliott)
* disable *Identify Points* for hexbin/grid plots and histograms (#326, @tmelliott)
* disable dot plots for survey data (#325, @tmelliott)

## iNZight 4.0.1

* fix UI bug requiring users to press Enter to set the null hypothesis value in the Get Inference window
* fix bug in restore plot for ggplots

# iNZight 4.0

This release is a complete overhaul of the way in which variables are passed around behind the scenes, making it possible to display and modify code for the current plot. The main focus for this release is to narrow the gap between GUI and coding for users interested in learning to use R.

## Major changes
* New `iNZInfoWindow` class to support both "Get Summary" and "Get Inference" which includes future scalability to code-writing and manual user-modifiable code snippets, plus an extensible command panel.
* New plot code panel displays the code for the current plot, and allows users to edit the code by hand.
* Survey designs can now be loaded from a file (.svydesign)

## Minor changes
* Add option to save interactive plots locally (including assets)
* Add support for JSON files
* Add data report (pdf/html/word) (using 'dataMaid' package)
* Add column selection and reordering dialog (File > Select and reorder variables)
* Adds ability to quickly reload iNZight from the File menu, preserving all changes
* Added better icons to the menus

## Bug fixes
Since this is a major release, it includes many bug fixes as part of the above major changes.

# iNZight 3.0
__Release date:__ 5 Septemer, 2016

This is a major new release of iNZight, so many things have changed.
We hope you like them!

### New Features

Here's just a few of the major new features to iNZight.

- Example data sets available from the File menu
- Play time can now be stopped, and the interval adjusted
- Switch variables with the one below by clicking the "down" arrow to the right of the variable box
- __Maps Module__ - visualise geographical data:
  - Coordinates: if your data set includes GPS coordinates for each observation,
    iNZight will let you plot them on a map.
  - Countries: if observations have country names associated with them,
    you can colour countries on a map by another variable.
    Try this out with the Gapminder data set included in Example Data!
- Dual Window mode - if you've used VIT, then this will be familiar to you. From File > Preferences,
  you can choose to have a separate window for graphs (as opposed to the built-in one).


### Major Changes

We can't list everything here, but some of the important ones are listed below.

- Plot toolbar has new icons
- Add to Plot window completely redesigned to make plot modification easier
- Resize points has been adjusted to resize the _area_ proportional to the value.
  Also added an "emphasize" option, which scales sizes linearly.
- __COLOUR__: new, better palettes have been introduced, including [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html),
  which are colourblind friendly.
- Multiple Response has been overhauled to be more intuitive and fit in with the rest of iNZight.
- (temporary) Just a quick workaround for analysing tables in iNZight: Dataset > Expand Table


### Minor Changes

Given the magnitude of changes, there's little point mentioning the minor ones and bug fixes!


***

## iNZight 2.5.1
__Release date:__ 16 November 2015

- correct the names and URLs in the 'Help > User Guides' menu
- fix bug that occurs when 'Colour by' variable has only one unique value


# iNZight 2.5
__Release date__: 08 November, 2015

## New Features

- specify colours for dotplots and scatterplots from the Add to Plot > Code more variables screen.


## iNZight 2.4.3
__Release date:__ 02 November 2015

- Improve smoothness of dotplot transitions by only redrawing
  when the scaling has changed.


## iNZight 2.4.2
__Release date:__ 28 October 2015

  issues on Mac attempting to manually install.


# iNZight 2.4
__Release date__: 12 October, 2015

### New Features

- Include FPC (finite population corrections) in survey designs

### Major Changes

- Replace the drag-drop boxes for variabes with drop-down
  boxes for an alternative method of variable
  selection. Drag-and-drop functionality has been retained.

### Bug Fixes

  are specified.
- When closing the survey design window, they specified design
  is now checked for validity before saving the design.
- Fix bug in the Multiple Response module that gave an
  "inverse" error message.
- Various other small fixes throughout iNZight and other
  dependency pacakges. See their change logs for details.


# iNZight 2.3
__Release date__: 4 August, 2015

## New Features

- SURVEY DESIGNS: iNZight can now handle survey designs
  (currently Strata, 2-stage (nesting) clustering, and a weighting
  variable. Plots take account of this structure and inference that
  displays (currently only trend lines on bivariate plots) use
  functions from the `survey` packages and thus incorporate weights.
- Adjust the axis limits from the Add to Plot menu.
- Adjust the number of bars displayed on a bar plot from the
  Add to Plot menu.

## Minor Changes

- the plot tool bar has been added to the Menubar at the top
  of the page. This allows users to work in a dual-window mode
  (with a narrow iNZight interface and a separate plotting window)
  and still be able to access plot functions.

## Bug Fixes

- fixes to a few issues occuring in dotplots
- display an error if Add to Plot is called without any
  variables having been selected


## iNZight 2.2.0-1
__Release date:__ 01 July 2015

- Fix mapping of confidence intervals (instead of comparison
  intervals) to Year 12 intervals in dot plots.


# iNZight 2.2
__Release date__: 16 June, 2015

### New Features

- users can specify a window size in File > Preferences
- Links to the User Guides found on our website have been
  added, including help buttons in the Add To Plot and Inference
  Information windows.

### Major Changes

- LOCATE functionality now included for dot plots. Also fixes
  several bugs in the previous update for locating points in
  scatter plot.

### Minor Changes

- the "Row Operations" menu has been renamed "Data"


## iNZight 2.1.1
__Release date:__ 09 June 2015

- fix a dependency issue required for aggregating data sets


# iNZight 2.1
__Release date__: 25 May, 2015

### New Features

- New hexagonal binning plot available to large samples
- Live updating sliders for the "Add to Plot" panel, which is
  now embedded into the main window rather than creating an
  additional pop-up window

### Major Changes

- The "Add to Plot", "Remove Additions" and
  "Inference Information" windows have been integrated into the main
  window with the aim of making the interface cleaner and easier to
  navigate.
- When colouring points by a numeric variable, a continuous colour
  range is used rather than a discrete one.
- The plotting package has been rewritten to accomodate survey
  designs (this will be integrated with iNZight itself at a later
  date). However, the plots have been modified to be cleaner and far
  more efficient. Additionally, the algorithms used for the
  inference information have been updated. For more information on
  this, see the iNZightPlots change log.
- The "Get Summary" and "Get Inference" outputs have been
  redesigned to hopefully give a more intuitive, cleaner
  presentation of the information.
- From dot plots and histograms, the comparison (and confidence)
  interval values can be read from the graph by clicking 'Get Values'
  in the 'Inference Information' panel. This includes the Year 12 intervals
  applied to medians.
- LOCATOR: functionality for scatterplots vastly improved,
  allowing selection of related points, retaining points over
  multiple graphcs, and selecting points by a variable.
  (similar upgrades for dot plots coming in v2.2)

### Minor Changes

- the number of missing values is now displayed on the plot,
  broken down by variable
- the list of options in the 'Add to Plot' window are now in a drop
  down menu, rather than radio buttons, to save space
- many other small UI improvements

### Bug Fixes

- if `colour by` is set, but the graph is changed to a histogram,
  the legend is removed from the plot
- fixes a bug in the plotting that was causing large values to fall off the axes
  of the plots
- includes other patches from the previous version of iNZight



## iNZight 2.0.4-4
__Release date:__ 10 March 2015

- ping for an internet connection before trying to check for updates


## iNZight 2.0.4-3

  "Restore default labels" is added to remove customised plot
  labels

### Bug Fixes

- Removes development text from Load Data window
- Fixes a bug in the Locate Points feature when the scales are
  vastly different
- Scroll bars added to Reorder Levels window
- The menu has been moved above the plot tabs, so it no longer
  gets cut off


## iNZight 2.0.3
__Release date__: 17 September, 2014

### Major Changes

- A new Multiple Response analysis module has been added to the
  Advanced menu. This utilises the iNZightMR package developed by
  Junjie Zeng

### Minor Changes

- "Add to Plot" window modified for barcharts - can show only
  CIs, and also selects comparison and confidence intervals by default

### Bug Fixes

- Includes a suite of bug fixes in the iNZightPlots package - see its
  NEWS file for these


## iNZight 2.0.2
__Release date__: 17 June, 2014

### New Features

- can now cycle through all two-variable plots for a selected
  Variable 1
- "play" button for the first subset by variable
  (automatically cycle levels)

### Minor Changes

- can now specify to identify min/max points in a dot plot
- in the Add to Plot window for barcharts, reworded "segment by" to "colour by"
  for consistency.
- the transparency slider now runs from 0% to 100%

### Bug Fixes

- identify functionality works for subsets (except when multi plots at once)


## iNZight 2.0.1
__Release date__: 27 March, 2014

### New Features

-  Identify feature added to the "Add To Plot" menu. This
  allows users to interactively label points with `id` or any other
  variable. This feature works for both dot plots and scatter plots.

### Minor Changes

- Users can force scatter plots when the sample size is large,
  rather than using the alternative grid-density plot.

- Missing observations can be converted to categorical
  levels. For categorical variables, the result is a new factor with
  the same levels as the original variable, but the additional
  `missing` factor level. For continuous variables, a new factor
  variable with two levels, `missing` and `not missing` is created.

### Bug Fixes

- Vertical sliders added to the `Rename Levels` and `Rename
      factor levels` windows.
- Reorder levels now works as expected, including sort by
  frequency.
- Bug where the iNZight window closes even if a user clicks
  `cancel` has been fixed.
